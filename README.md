# Cleaning-Bank-Marketing-Data-for-Campaign
## [ Mini Project ] : Tasked with cleaning marketing campaign data on personal loans to meet specified structure and data types for a PostgreSQL database, enabling storage and easy integration of future campaigns. 

''' Personal loans are a lucrative revenue stream for banks. The typical interest rate of a two-year loan in the United Kingdom is 
around 10%. This might not sound like a lot, but in September 2022 alone UK consumers borrowed around £1.5 billion, which would mean approximately £300 million in interest generated by banks over 2 years! '''

### Simulated situations : 
###### Asked to work with a bank to clean data collected from a recent marketing campaign aimed at encouraging customers to take out a personal loan. The cleaned data must conform to the specific structure and data types specified by the bank in order to plan future marketing campaigns. This data will be used to set up a PostgreSQL database, which will store the current campaign’s data and allow for the easy import of data from future campaigns.
